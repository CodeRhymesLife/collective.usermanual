"Plone is a content management system (CMS) which you can use to build a web "
"site. With Plone, ordinary people can contribute content to a web site "
"without the help of a computer geek. Plone runs over the Web, too, so you "
"don't need to install any special software on your computer. The word "
"*content* is meant to be general, because you can publish so many types of "
"information, including:"

"A Plone web site contains various kinds of content, including text, photos, "

"computer. You create *folders* on a Plone web site to hold content and to "

"details, but one of Plone's advantages is that you don't need to know (much)"
