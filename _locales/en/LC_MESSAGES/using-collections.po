"A confusing thing about dates can be how its Criteria are set up. They have "
"a setup that is not like any of the other Criteria. First off, you have to "
"choose whether you want a Relative Date or a Date Range."

"The Relative Date allows you to construct a **conditional statement**. Such "
"as: Items modified less than 5 days in the past. A Date Range will allow you"
" to **specify an exact range of dates**, such as 01/02/08 to 02/02/08. The "
"Date Range is useful when you want to create a Collection with a static date"
" that won't change. The Relative Date can be very useful as it will allow "
"you to create Collections that are automatically updating themselves, such "
"as a Recent News Collections or an Upcoming Event Section."

"The last option is **More or Less**. Here we can choose from three options. "
"*Less than* allows us to include everything from now to a period of time "
"equal to or less than the **Which Day** setting, either in the past or "
"future. *More than* will include everything from beyond our specified number"
" of days equal to or more than **Which Day**. Finally *On the Day* will only"
" include things that are on the day we specified in the **Which Day**. Using"
" the example in the image above if we had selected *On the Day* instead of "
"*Less than* our Collection would display only objects that were modified (we"
